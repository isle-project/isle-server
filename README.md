## Introduction

Server program for *integrated statistics learning environment* (ISLE) lessons. Other parts of the ISLE environment are: 

-   the [isle-editor][isle-editor] is used to author ISLE lessons
-   the [isle-dashboard][isle-dashboard] is the online dashboard used to deploy, organize and monitor ISLE lessons

#### [Open Documentation][docs]

#### Prerequisites

Developing and running the ISLE server has the following prerequisites:

* [git][git]: version control
* [Node.js][node-js]: JavaScript runtime (version `>= 14.0`)
* [MongoDB][mongodb]: NoSQL document database

#### Download

To acquire the source code, clone the git repository.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/isle-project/isle-server
```

#### Installation

To install development dependencies,

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Encryption of Sensitive Files

Files in the `credentials` folder have been [transcrypted][transcrypt]. 

### Starting

To start the server,

``` bash
npm start 
```

To make sure the server restarts in case of a crash, it is advised to use it via [pm2][pm2]: 

``` bash
pm2 start lib/index.js --name isle-server
```

### Tests

#### Unit

The server uses [tape][tape] for unit tests. To run the tests, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

``` bash
$ npm test
```

#### Test Coverage

This repository uses [Istanbul][istanbul] as its code coverage tool. To generate a test coverage report, execute the following command in the top-level application directory:

```bash
$ npm run test-cov
```

Istanbul creates a `./reports/coverage` directory with an HTML version of the report.
